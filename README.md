# Reclaimarr

A Python CLI tool to automatically manage disk space by intelligently deleting media from a Jellyfin media stack based on watch history, age, and usage patterns.

## Features

- **Intelligent Deletion:** Prioritizes media for deletion based on watch history (never watched, last watched date).
- **Multi-API Integration:** Fetches data from Jellyfin, Jellystat, Jellyseerr, Radarr, and Sonarr for a holistic view of your media.
- **Disk Space Management:** Automatically deletes media to keep disk usage below a configurable target percentage.
- **Safety First:** Includes a `DRY_RUN` mode to preview deletions without affecting your files.
- **Configurable:** Easily configure API endpoints, keys, and deletion thresholds via a `.env` file.
- **Dockerized:** Comes with a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy, containerized deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- Access to a Jellyfin media stack with the following services:
  - Jellyfin
  - Jellystat
  - Jellyseerr
  - Radarr
  - Sonarr

## Deployment

Reclaimarr is designed to run as a long-running container with a built-in scheduler. The easiest way to deploy it is by adding it to your existing media stack's `docker-compose.yml`.

### Docker Compose Example

Here is a sample `docker-compose.yml` configuration for Reclaimarr. You can add this service to your main compose file.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  reclaimarr:
    image: ghcr.io/okhr/reclaimarr:latest
    container_name: reclaimarr
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      # --- Required API Settings ---
      # Assumes you are running Reclaimarr in the same Docker network as your other services.
      - JELLYFIN_URL=http://jellyfin:8096
      - JELLYFIN_API_KEY=${JELLYFIN_API_KEY} # Replace with your actual key or variable
      - JELLYSTAT_URL=http://jellystat:3000
      - JELLYSTAT_API_KEY=${JELLYSTAT_API_KEY}
      - JELLYSEERR_URL=http://jellyseerr:5055
      - JELLYSEERR_API_KEY=${JELLYSEERR_API_KEY}
      - RADARR_URL=http://radarr:7878
      - RADARR_API_KEY=${RADARR_API_KEY}
      - SONARR_URL=http://sonarr:8989
      - SONARR_API_KEY=${SONARR_API_KEY}
      
      # --- Required Path ---
      - MEDIA_PATH=/media

      # --- Optional Settings ---
      - TARGET_USAGE=80
      - MIN_AGE_DAYS=90
      - DRY_RUN=true
      - VERBOSE=false
      - CRON_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * *" # Runs every day at 3 AM. If blank, runs once.
    volumes:
      # Mount your media library. This path must match the one used by your other services.
      # Example: /srv/media on your host machine.
      - /srv/media:/media
```

### Running the Service

1.  Save the configuration above as `docker-compose.yml`.
2.  Create a `.env` file in the same directory to store your secret API keys (e.g., `JELLYFIN_API_KEY=your_key_here`).
3.  Start the service in detached mode:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The container will now run in the background, executing the deletion logic based on the `CRON_SCHEDULE` you provide.

## Deletion Algorithm

The script prioritizes media for deletion based on the following logic:

1.  **Filter by Age:** Only media older than `MIN_AGE_DAYS` (default: 90) is considered.
2.  **Primary Sort (Never Watched):** Media that has never been watched is prioritized first, sorted by the date it was added (oldest first).
3.  **Secondary Sort (Watched):** Media that has been watched is sorted by the last watched date (oldest first).

The script will delete items from this prioritized list one by one until the disk usage of your media library drops below the `TARGET_USAGE` percentage.

## Configuration

All configuration is handled via the `.env` file. Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values for your environment.

```

### Deletion & Scheduler Settings
```
# The target disk usage percentage (e.g., 80 for 80%).
TARGET_USAGE=80
# The minimum age in days before a media item can be deleted.
MIN_AGE_DAYS=90
# The path to your media library inside the Docker container.
MEDIA_PATH=/media
# Set to "true" to run in dry-run mode (no files deleted), or "false" to perform deletions.
DRY_RUN=true
# Set to "true" for verbose logging.
VERBOSE=false
# A cron-style string to schedule runs (e.g., "0 3 * * *"). If blank, runs once.
CRON_SCHEDULE="0 3 * * *"
